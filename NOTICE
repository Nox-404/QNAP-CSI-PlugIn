3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,

each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise

transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to

which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation

against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes

direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to

You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such

litigation is filed.



4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

    this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from

    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

    any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then

    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those

    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the

    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

    cannot be construed as modifying the License.



You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or

rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

liability.

Artistic License 1.0 (Perl)

(base-files 11.1+deb11u1)

The "Artistic License"

======================



Preamble



The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may

be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic

control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the

package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary

fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.



Definitions:



  *  "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright

    Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual

    modification.



  *  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or

    has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as

    specified below.



  *  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for

    the package.



  *  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.



  *  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media

    cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not

    be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing

    community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)



  *  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though

    there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that

    recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they

    received it.



  1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the

    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you

    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.



  2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived

    from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in

    such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.



  3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that

    you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you

    changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:



      a.  place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them

        Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an

        equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site

        such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your

        modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.



      b.  use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.



      c.  rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with

        standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate

        manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how

        it differs from the Standard Version.



      d.  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



  4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable

    form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:



      a.  distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,

        together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to

        get the Standard Version.



      b.  accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the

        Package with your modifications.



      c.  give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document

        the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with

        instructions on where to get the Standard Version.



      d.  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



  5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this

    Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You

    may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute

    this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part

    of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do

    not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this

    Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall

    be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete

    Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.



  6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output

    from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the

    copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be

    sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts

    or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump"

    or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution

    of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package

    nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that

    you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this

    Package.



  7.  C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)

    supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines

    and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered

    part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6,

    provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would

    cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.



  8.  Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always

    permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no

    overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end

    user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a

    distribution of this Package.



  9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote

    products derived from this software without specific prior written

    permission.



  10.  THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED

    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)

====================================





Version 2, June 1991

--------------------



Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most

of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors

commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by

the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your

programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can

do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

software, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them

these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer

you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or

modify the software.



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the

software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to

know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by

others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish

to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually

obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent

this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free

use or not licensed at all.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice

    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms

    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such

    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program

    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing

    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included

    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as

    "you".



    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered

    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program

    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its

    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been

    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the

    Program does.



  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and

    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this

    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of

    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.



    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may

    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus

    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such

    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you

    also meet all of these conditions:



      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

        that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or

        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to

        be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms

        of this License.



      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an

        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or

        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute

        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a

        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive

        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the

        Program is not required to print an announcement.)



    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably

    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,

    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as

    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole

    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be

    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to

    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the

    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on

    the Program.



    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with

    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or

    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this

    License.



  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under

    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically

        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the

        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections

        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to

        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only

        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in

        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with

        Subsection b above.)



    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all

    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface

    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and

    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source

    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in

    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,

    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that

    component itself accompanies the executable.



    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to

    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,

    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the

    object code.



  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as

    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically

    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received

    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the

    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you

    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the

    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of

    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,

    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.



  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),

    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of

    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance

    by third parties to this License.



  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse

    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to

    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other

    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the

    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit

    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies

    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both

    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the

    Program.



    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and

    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents

    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;

    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free

    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license

    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of

    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent

    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or

    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee

    cannot impose that choice.



    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

    consequence of the rest of this License.



  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain

    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original

    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an

    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so

    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.

    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the

    body of this License.



  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar

    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

    problems or concerns.



    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later

    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of

    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software

    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,

    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make

    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of

    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of

    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



    NO WARRANTY



  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR

    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE

    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND

    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,

    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE

    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY

    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE

    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR

    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR

    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH

    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

starts in an interactive mode:



Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome

to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'

for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or

menu items--whatever suits your program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright

interest in the program `Gnomovision'

(which makes passes at compilers) written

by James Hacker.



signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

Ty Coon, President of Vice



This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead

of this License.
